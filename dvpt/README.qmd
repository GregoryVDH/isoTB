# isoTB: Stable Isotope Geochemistry Tool Box

## Overview

The isoTB package provides multiple tools to help process empirical or model stable isotope geochemistry data for environmental science studies. The isoTB package provides simple conversion functions to convert between different isotopic composition notations (*e.g.* isotope ratio, delta notation, fractional abundance), isotope mixing models, isotope mixing model solvers and functions to calculate the isotope fractionation of sources.

The isoTB package also provides very useful functions for enriched isotope tracer studies enabling (i) to calculate the error induced by neglecting isotope fractionation processes in tracing studies and (ii) to calculate the minimum isotope enrichment of the tracer source in a system to ensure that the aforementioned error is below a user-defined threshold.

isoTB can be used to model complex systems for both natural variations of isotope ratios and enriched isotope tracer studies by creating the different reservoirs in the system and defining the interactions (isotope mixing, isotope fractionation) between the different reservoirs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of isoTB from GitHub like so:

``` r 
# Using the pak package to install directly from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("gregoryVDH/isoTB") 

# Using the devtools package to install directly from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gregoryVDH/isoTB") 
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(isoTB)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
